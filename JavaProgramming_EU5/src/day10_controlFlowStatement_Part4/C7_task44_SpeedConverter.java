		 * their values converted to miles per hour(MPH). The formula for converting KPH
		 * to MPH is: MPH = KPH * 0.6214 The table that your program displays should
		 * show speeds from 60 kilometers per hour thru 130 kilometers per hour, in
		 * increments of 10, along with their values converted to miles per hour. The
